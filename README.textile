h1. Rails3 + Devise + RSpec + Cucumber

This is an example Rails 3 application that shows how to use "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise with "RSpec":http://rspec.info/ and "Cucumber":http://cukes.info/. Devise gives you ready-made authentication and user management. RSpec is a popular alternative to the Test::Unit testing framework. Cucumber is often used with RSpec for Behaviour Driven Development.

Best of all, there's a "detailed tutorial":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber/wiki/Tutorial (walk-through) to show how it's built.

You can clone this app or generate a new Rails application using this app as a template.

h2. "Building It" Tutorial

A complete walkthrough tutorial is available on the GitHub wiki:

h4. "View the Tutorial":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber/wiki/Tutorial

The tutorial documents each step to follow to create the application. Every step is documented concisely, so a complete beginner can create this application without any additional knowledge. However, no explanation is offered for any of the steps, so if you are a beginner, you’re advised to look for an introduction to Rails elsewhere.

If you simply wish to modify the application for your own project, you can download the application and set it up as described below, without following the tutorial.

h2. What Is Implemented -- and What Is Not

This is a demonstration application that allows you to visit a home page and see a list of users. With the default user's email and password (supplied below), you can log in and view details for each user. You can customize this app as you need.

h4. Similar Examples and Tutorials

If you'd like to use the Mongoid ORM with the MongoDB datastore instead of ActiveRecord and a SQLite database, see the "rails3-mongoid-devise":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise example app and tutorial. Mongoid makes development quicker without schemas or migrations. The "rails3-mongoid-devise":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-mongoid-devise example app and tutorial shows how to set up Devise and Mongoid with RSpec and Cucumber.

h2. Dependencies

Before running this app, you need to install 

* The Ruby language (version 1.8.7 or 1.9.2)
* Rails (version 3.0.7)

I recommend installing rvm, the "Ruby Version Manager":http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/, to manage multiple versions of Rails.

Check that appropriate versions of Ruby and Rails are installed in your development environment:
@$ ruby -v@
@$ rails -v@

h2. Getting the Application

You have several options for getting the code.

h4. Downloading the Code

If you simply wish to examine the example code, you can download the code ("clone the repository") with the command

@$ git clone git://github.com/fortuity/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber.git@

The source code is managed with Git (a version control system). You'll need Git on your machine (install it from "http://git-scm.com/":http://git-scm.com/).

h4. Using the Ready-Made Application Template

You can use an application template to generate a new version of the example app. You’ll find an application template for this app in the "fortuity/rails3-application-templates":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates repository.

Use the command:

@$ rails new APP_NAME -m https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-application-templates/raw/master/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber-template.rb -T -J@

Use the @-T -J@ flags to skip Test::Unit files and Prototype files.

bq. You MUST be using Rails 3.0.4 or newer. Generating a Rails application from an “HTTPS” URL does not work in Rails 3.0.3 and earlier versions.

This creates a new Rails app (with the @APP_NAME@ you provide) on your computer.

The application generator template will ask you for your preferences:

* Would you like to use jQuery instead of Prototype?
* Would you like to use jQuery UI?
* Would you like to use Haml instead of ERB?
* Would you like to use RSpec instead of TestUnit?
* Would you like to use factory_girl for test fixtures with RSpec?
* Would you like to use Cucumber for your BDD?
* Would you like to use Devise for authentication?
* Would you like to set a robots.txt file to ban spiders?

h4. Use "Recipes" to Customize an Application Template

The "tutorial":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber/wiki/Tutorial shows how a customized application template can be assembled from "recipes." The application template was created using the "rails3_devise_wizard":https://github.com/fortuity/rails3_devise_wizard gem which provides a convenient way to assemble a reusable application template by selecting various "recipes" for popular Rails development packages.

h4. Please Remember: Edit the README

If you're open sourcing the app on GitHub, please edit the README file to add a description of the app and your contact info. Changing the README is important if you're using a clone of the example app. I've been mistaken (and contacted) as the author of apps that are copied from my example.

h2. Getting Started

h3. About Required Gems

The application uses the following gems. I recommend checking for newer versions of these gems before proceeding:

* rails "(check rubygems.org for a newer gem)":http://rubygems.org/gems/rails
* devise "(Check rubygems.org for a newer gem)":http://rubygems.org/gems/devise
* rspec-rails "(Check rubygems.org for a newer gem)":http://rubygems.org/gems/rspec-rails
* database_cleaner "(Check rubygems.org for a newer gem)":http://rubygems.org/gems/database_cleaner
* factory_girl_rails "(Check rubygems.org for a newer gem)":http://rubygems.org/gems/factory_girl_rails
* cucumber-rails "(Check rubygems.org for a newer gem)":http://rubygems.org/gems/cucumber-rails
* capybara "(Check rubygems.org for a newer gem)":http://rubygems.org/gems/capybara

The app has been tested with the indicated versions. If you are able to build the app with a newer gem, please create an "issue":http://github.com/fortuity/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber/issues on GitHub and I will update the app.

h3. Install the Required Gems

Install the required gems on your computer:

@$ bundle install@

You can check which gems are installed on your computer with:

@$ gem list --local@

Keep in mind that you have installed these gems locally. When you deploy the app to another server, the same gems (and versions) must be available.

h3. Set Up Configuration for Devise

This app uses Devise for user management and authentication. Devise is at "http://github.com/plataformatec/devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise.

You can modify the configuration file for Devise if you want to use something other than the defaults:

*config/initializers/devise.rb*

h3. Configure Email for Devise

Configure email by modifying

*config/initializers/devise.rb*

and setting the return email address for emails sent from the application.

You may need to set values for your mailhost in

*config/environments/development.rb*
*config/environments/production.rb*

h2. Create a Default User

h3. Set Up a Database Seed File

You'll want to set up a default user so you can easily log in to test the app. You can modify the file *db/seeds.rb* for your own name, email and password:

<pre>
puts 'SETTING UP DEFAULT USER LOGIN'
user = User.create! :name => 'First User', :email => 'user@test.com', :password => 'please', :password_confirmation => 'please'
puts 'New user created: ' << user.name
</pre>

Use the defaults or change the values for name, email, and password as you wish.

h3. Seed the Database

Add the default user to the database by running the command:

@$ rake db:migrate@
@$ rake db:seed@

h3. Test the App

You can check that your app runs properly by entering the command

@$ rails server@

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000. You should see the default user listed on the home page. When you click on the user's name, you should be required to log in before seeing the user's detail page.

To sign in as the default user, (unless you've changed it) use

* email: user@test.com
* password: please

You should delete or change the pre-configured logins before you deploy your application.

h2. Deploying to Heroku

h3. Set Up Heroku

For your convenience, here are instructions for deploying your app to Heroku. Heroku provides low cost, easily configured Rails application hosting.

To deploy this app to Heroku, you must have a Heroku account. If you need to obtain one, visit "http://heroku.com/":http://heroku.com/ to set up an account. 

Make sure the Heroku gem is in your *Gemfile* "(check rubygems.org for the latest heroku gem)":http://rubygems.org/gems/heroku:

@gem "heroku"

If it's not, add it and run

@$ bundle install@

to set up your gems again.

Add your public key immediately after installing the heroku gem so that you can use git to push or clone Heroku app repositories. See "http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command":http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command for details.

h3. Create Your Application on Heroku

Use the Heroku create command to create and name your new app.

@$ heroku create _myapp_@

As of 9 February 2011, bamboo-ree-1.8.7 is the default stack for new Heroku apps.

If you want to use Ruby 1.9.2, you can create your app with:

@heroku create _myapp_ --stack bamboo-mri-1.9.2@

h3. Check Heroku Configuration

You can check that everything has been added correctly by running:

@$ heroku info --app myapp@

If you see @Stack: bamboo-ree-1.8.7@ and you want to use Ruby 1.9.2, you can migrate:

@heroku stack:migrate bamboo-mri-1.9.2@

h3. Push Your Application to Heroku

Push your application to Heroku:

@$ git push heroku master@

Initialize your application database:

@$ heroku rake db:seed@

h3. Visit Your Site

Open your Heroku site in your default web browser:

@$ heroku open@

h3. Troubleshooting

If you get errors, you can troubleshoot by reviewing the log files:

@$ heroku logs@

h2. Customizing

"Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise provides a variety of features for implementing authentication. See the Devise documentation for options.

This application provides no useful functionality apart from demonstrating Devise with RSpec and Cucumber working together on Rails 3. Add any models, controllers, and views that you need.

h2. Testing

The application contains RSpec unit tests and Cucumber scenarios and steps. The tests are minimal and can be improved.

Please send the author a message, create an issue, or submit a pull request if you can contribute improved RSpec or Cucumber files.

After installing the application, run @rake -T@ to check that rake tasks for RSpec and Cucumber are available.

Run @rake spec@ to run all RSpec tests.

Run @rake cucumber@ (or more simply, @cucumber@) to run all Cucumber scenarios and steps.

You can browse and search the Cucumber features at the "Relish":http://relishapp.com/fortuity/rails3-devise-rspec-cucumber website.

h2. Documentation and Support

This is the only documentation.

For a Devise introduction, Ryan Bates offers a "Railscast on Devise":http://railscasts.com/episodes/209-introducing-devise. You can find documentation for "Devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise at "http://github.com/plataformatec/devise":http://github.com/plataformatec/devise.
